Fix iconv warning
=================

Change the content of client/node_modules/encoding/lib/iconv_loader.js with :

'use strict';

var iconv_package;
var Iconv;

try {
    // this is to fool browserify so it doesn't try (in vain) to install iconv.
    //iconv_package = 'iconv';
    //Iconv = require(iconv_package).Iconv;
} catch (E) {
    // node-iconv not present
}

module.exports = Iconv;

This is because of the browserify workaround that webpack doesn't likes.
